random seed:                     0                 (the random seed value)
max subexpression values:        5                 (how many numbers, functions, or subexpressions per expression or subexpression)
max subexpression depth:         5                 (how many levels of subexpressions there can be)
max consecutive unaries:         5                 (how many unary operators can appear in a row)
max digits in an int:            3                 (how many digits an int can have)
max lefthand digits in a float:  3                 (how many digits can be to the left of the dot in a float)
max righthand digits in a float: 3                 (how many digits can be to the right of the dot in a float)
max allowed error:               0.00000001        (largest absolute difference from expected result before the test is considered an error)
timeout:                         0.01              (max time a function can take to evaluate before timeout occurs)
tests:                           1000              (how many tests without errors should be ran)
random error chance:             50                (how often to add an error, e.g. if this is 50 then add an error to 1 in 50 tests)
